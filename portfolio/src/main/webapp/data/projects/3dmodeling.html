<h3 class="u-italic">Interactive 3D Modeling in JavaScript</h3>
<p class="bp"><br>An interactive 3D modeling program written in JavaScript.</p>
<p class="bp">As I was creating this website, I had no idea what to feature on the homepage. I did know I wanted something interactive, something I could code myself. I ended up with the idea of a dot mesh: an interactive wave pattern comprised of many small, movable points. As I brainstormed how to implement this idea, it became clear that the best solution would be to write a 3D modeling program. Not something incredibly robust, but something that could project 3D coordinates onto a 2D plane. At first my hopes were low that JavaScript could handle such a computation-heavy program, but after a bit of testing and research, it seemed like the idea would work. Once the 3D engine was finally built (and little shifting dots had imprinted themselves on the back of my eyelids) all that was left was to plug in coordinates.</p>
<p class="bp">The program uses HTML DOM elements to represent individual points on a three dimensional Cartesian plane which makeup a 3D model of any shape or pattern I take the time to encode. The program then projects (with perspective) these 3D points onto a 2D viewing frame which is what you see. The idea has evolved a bit from just an interactive mesh, and now takes the form of morphing shapes which I have predesigned. You can also distort these shapes by hovering your cursor near points. Enter interactive mode (by pressing [i]) to rotate, morph, and select specific shapes. Explore the program below.</p>

<p class="bp"><b>P.S.</b> This 3D modeling project also sparked the development of another project: a simple, yet versatile JavaScript web animations library. With all the moving parts of this project, I needed a robust method to maintain all of its animations. There are plenty well established and comprehensive animation libraries already out there, but for this project I felt compelled to see if I could manage without any third-party libraries. In adhering this standard, I have been piecing together my own small animations library which has helped bring this project to life. Once this library is more fleshed out, perhaps it will earn its own page. You can check out the documentation below.</p>
