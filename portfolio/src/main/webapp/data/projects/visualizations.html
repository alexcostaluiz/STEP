<h3 class="u-italic">Algorithm Visualizations</h3>
<p class="bp"><br>A visualization tool for classic sorting and searching algorithms.</p>
<p class="bp">Understanding all kinds of algorithms is notoriously one of the more difficult aspects of computer science. In my experience, I have looked up and read about the same sorting and path algoritms over and over again trying to nail down a lasting understanding of them. Tired of rereading the same Wikipedia articles again and again, however, I decided it was time to approach my algorithm education differently. And so I thought, what better way to learn these algorithms than by creating my own visualizations of them? After all, this is where I often ended up: looking up visualizations to guide my understanding. In the short run, exploring others' visualizations proved to be quite helpful, but never left me quite satisfied with my understanding. In creating my own visualizations, however, I'd be forced to really dive deep into the guts of these algorithms and hopefully come out with an enduring understanding of them.</p>
