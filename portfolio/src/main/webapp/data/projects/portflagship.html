<h3 class="u-italic">Portuguese Flagship Website Redesign</h3>
<p class="bp"><br>A custom redesign of the website for the Portuguese Flagship Program at the University of Georgia.</p>
<p class="bp">While I worked for the UGA Portugese Flagship Program doing website maintenance, I had the opportunity to redesign their website. Although the redesign is still on its way to production (the origninal site may be viewed <a target="_blank" href="http://portflagship.org"><u>here</u></a>), I used PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the Vue JavaScript Framework to write a completely custom website for the program. Below is the culmination of these efforts.</p>
